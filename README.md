# ThriftBear Jekyll-templated single page website

## Installation

On a Mac, all you should have to do is

`sudo gem install jekyll`

Then get the bundler (like npm, but for Ruby)

`sudo gem install bundler`

Quit terminal, reopen it.  Go to the directory that contains the Gemfile and install all the things.

```
cd src
bundle install
```

You may be prompted for your admin password.

## Preview / Development

The root of the directory has a `package.json` file to make your life easier. 

To build and start a local preview with livereload, go back to the root directory and run

`npm run start`

Open a browser to `localhost:4000`.
